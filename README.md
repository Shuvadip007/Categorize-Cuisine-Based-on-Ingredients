# Categorize Cuisine Based on Ingredients

## Overview
This project aims to classify the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients. Given a list of ingredients, the model predicts the category of cuisine it belongs to, such as Italian, Indian, Korean, or Mexican.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of a collection of dishes with their corresponding ingredients and labeled cuisine types. The data provides insight into regional and cultural food patterns based on ingredient combinations.

## Problem Statement
Some of our strongest geographic and cultural associations are tied to a region's local foods. This project explores the ability to predict the category of a dish's cuisine using only its ingredient list.

## Features
- **Ingredient-based Classification**: The model learns cuisine types based on ingredient composition.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Predicts one of several possible cuisines.
- **Machine Learning Approach**: Utilizes NLP and classification techniques.

## Installation
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shuvadip007/categorize-cuisine.git
cd categorize-cuisine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook Categorize_Cuisine_Based_on_Ingredients.ipynb
```

## Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks** (optional extension)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Future Enhancements
- Expand dataset with more diverse cuisines.
- Improve classification using deep learning (LSTMs or Transformers).
- Build a web app for user input-based predictions.
